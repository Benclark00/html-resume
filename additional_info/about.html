<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Before starting my journey in tech, I was quite interested in the field of medicine,
  unfortunately this field and my first college were not for me. While in between schools,
  I began working full time as a line cook and teaching myself python in my free time. This
  learning helped me realize my passion for development and pushed me to go back to school to 
  learn more at my local college, VCU. It has been a long and exciting journey and I can not 
  to see where the next stop is on this life long adventure.
